## ABOUT ME
Hello! I am Haruka Takagi, welcome to my data science portfolio. I am currently in my final year at the University of Toronto, St. George. In the progress of attaining an Honours Bachelor of Science Degree with a Double Major in Statistics & Economics, and a Minor in Mathematics in May 2023. I have been a Dean's List Scholar at UofT for 2020 & 2021. And was granted the University of Toronto Excellence Award for Research in 2022.

In industry, I have 1 year of experience working as a Machine Learning/Natural Language Processing Engineer at an AI Emotion Recognition company in Tokyo, Japan, as well as internship experience as an Analyst at Bloomberg L.P. 

In academia, I have 3 years of experience working as a Financial Data Analytics/ML/NLP Research assistant on 3 different university research projects with the University of Toronto Munk School of Public Policy, Department of Management and Department of Finance. Currently, I am working on a research project with Professor Charles Martineau, Professor Pat Akey, and Professor Vincent Gregoire as the only undergraduate Co-Author on a Finance working paper examining central bank communication by extracting agreement levels from FOMC transcripts using NLP methods.

I am actively looking for Data Analyst, Data Scientist & Financial Analyst roles for May 2023 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada! Please feel free to reach out to me via email if you think I would be a great addition to your team! I'd be happy to hop on a video or phone call to talk about my experiences and projects on this portfolio.

## PROJECT OVERVIEWS
Below is a description and brief overview for each data science project!

[1. Data/Statistical Analysis I: Housing Sale Price Analysis](https://haruka-takagi-datascience.github.io/data_analysis_I/)<br />
This project explores data from the Toronto Real Estate Board (TREB) on detached houses in Toronto and Missisauga. We will use this dataset to estabilish a multiple linear regression model (MLR) which home buyers can use to predict the sale price of single-family, detached homes. The report settles on the Backwards AIC model for feature selection, and finds location to be the largest swayer of sale price, with the number of bedrooms at second most importance. We also found that taxes does not influence sale price as much as expected. <br />
<br />
**Subject Areas**: Data Manipulation, Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Selection, Statistical Diagnostics <br />
<br />
<br />
[2. Data/Statistical Analysis II: EU Powersector Analysis](https://github.com/haruka-takagi-datascience/data_analysis_II)<br />
This project is an investigation into the European Union Power Section and its Clean Energy Status. The data used for this report is from EuroStat, and it investigated the 2019 statistics annual electricity data from 2016 to 2018 on the volumes of electricity that have been produced and supplied at the level of the European Union. The overarching finding was that clean renewable energy production integration is going very well and has progressed in the European Union. With specific findings such as, with 95% probability, the true proportion of EU countries that have met their target in 2018 is between 0.21 and 0.44 based on prior information. <br />
<br />
**Subject Areas**:  Data Analysis, Statistical Analysis, Goodness of Fit Test, Bayesian Credible Intervals, etc. <br />
